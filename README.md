I am currently exploring the Sagebrush/Pinyon-Juniper communities of the Central Basin and Range. I am interested in how these communties (or is it a community) interalte and dsientagling how much their realationship is successional and how much is ecotonal. I am currently exploring the relationship of three:shrub cover, communiyt identity and climate influence how fire impacts these communities.
